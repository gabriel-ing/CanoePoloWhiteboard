      This is a tool to sketch, display and animate tactics and plays in canoe
      polo.
    </p>
    <h3>Interface</h3>
    <p>There are several buttons at the top:</p>
    <img src="Intro_images/Icons.png" />

    <p>There is a toolbar at the bottom with a number of options.</p>
    <p>
      Here you can choose the number of each colour boats and turn the ball on
      and off - in case you want to simplify situations.
    </p>

    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <img src="Intro_images/Animation_gif.gif" />
    <p>Animating your plays is simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save an initial position use "Add Frame"</li>
      <li>
        Move your boats and ball to a new position and click "Add Frame" again.
      </li>
      <li>Keep adding frames until your play is complete.</li>
      <li>
        Click "Play" and it will smoothly animate between the positions. To
        change the speed use the "Animation speed" dropdown
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to edit your play, use the slider to navigate through the
        saved positions. Edit the positions and press "Rewrite frame"
      </li>
      <li>To start over click reset.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can save the positions for the animation into a json file, using "Save
      Animation File" and load an animation file using "Load File". You can save
      an image with the save image button.<br />
      Unfortunately there is no built in method to create a recording, but I
      recommend recording your screen or using
      <a href="https://gifcap.dev/">gifcap.dev</a> to create an animated gif.
    </p>
    <h3>First person view</h3>
    <img src="Intro_images/3D_gif.gif" />
    <p>
      To visualise how a tactic would look during a game, there is a 3D
      first-person mode. This view allows a player to recognise and understand
      what the play would look and feel like when in the middle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create this, simply draw out an animation as before, then press "3D
      mode". There are limited controls here - choose the boat number for the
      viewpoint, change the speed of the animation and replay the animation
      using "reset".
    </p>
    <p>
      If you click "return to whiteboard" it should keep the animation saved and
      open so you can make any adjustments to the play in 2D before returning to
      view it in 3D.
    </p>
    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>
      This project was created entirely by me, Gabriel Ing, however I must thank
      and credit Jack Watt. His feedback, advice and bug-spotting was
      invaluable, and the 3D mode was all his idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks also to Forth Canoe Club who collectively taught me everything I
      know about the sport.
